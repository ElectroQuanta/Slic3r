** PRINT OPTIONS **
	--adaptive-slicing!                     	Automatically determine layer heights by the objects topology instead of using the static value.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--adaptive_slicing_quality=f            	Controls the quality / printing time tradeoff for adaptive layer generation. 0 -> fastest printing with max layer height, 100 -> highest quality, min layer height
	                                        	 (default: 75%)
	--avoid-crossing-perimeters!            	Optimize travel moves in order to minimize the crossing of perimeters. This is mostly useful with Bowden extruders which suffer from oozing. This feature slows down both the print and the G-code generation.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--bed-shape=s

	--bed-temperature=i                     	Bed temperature for layers after the first one.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--before-layer-gcode=s                  	This custom code is inserted at every layer change, right before the Z move. Note that you can use placeholder variables for all Slic3r settings as well as [layer_num], [layer_z] and [current_retraction].
	                                        	 (default: )
	--between-objects-gcode=s               	This code is inserted between objects when using sequential printing. By default extruder and bed temperature are reset using non-wait command; however if M104, M109, M140 or M190 are detected in this custom code, Slic3r will not add temperature commands. Note that you can use placeholder variables for all Slic3r settings, so you can put a "M109 S[first_layer_temperature]" command wherever you want.
	                                        	 (default: )
	--bottom-infill-pattern=s               	Infill pattern for bottom layers. This only affects the external visible layer, and not its adjacent solid shells.
	                                        	 (default: rectilinear)
	--bottom-solid-layers=i                 	Number of solid layers to generate on bottom surfaces.
	                                        	 (default: 3)
	--bridge-acceleration=f                 	This is the acceleration your printer will use for bridges. Set zero to disable acceleration control for bridges.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--bridge-fan-speed=i                    	This fan speed is enforced during all bridges and overhangs.
	                                        	 (default: 100)
	--bridge-flow-ratio=f                   	This factor affects the amount of plastic for bridging. You can decrease it slightly to pull the extrudates and prevent sagging, although default settings are usually good and you should experiment with cooling (use a fan) before tweaking this.
	                                        	 (default: 1)
	--bridge-speed=f                        	Speed for printing bridges.
	                                        	 (default: 60)
	--brim-connections-width=f              	If set to a positive value, straight connections will be built on the first layer between adjacent objects.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--brim-width=f                          	Horizontal width of the brim that will be printed around each object on the first layer.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--complete-objects!                     	When printing multiple objects or copies, this feature will complete each object before moving onto next one (and starting it from its bottom layer). This feature is useful to avoid the risk of ruined prints. Slic3r should warn and prevent you from extruder collisions, but beware.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--cooling!                              	This flag enables the automatic cooling logic that adjusts print speed and fan speed according to layer printing time.
	                                        	 (default: 1)
	--default-acceleration=f                	This is the acceleration your printer will be reset to after the role-specific acceleration values are used (perimeter/infill). Set zero to prevent resetting acceleration at all.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--disable-fan-first-layers=i            	This disables the fan completely for the first N layers to aid in the adhesion of media to the bed. (default 3)
	                                        	 (default: 3)
	--dont-support-bridges!                 	Experimental option for preventing support material from being generated under bridged areas.
	                                        	 (default: 1)
	--duplicate-distance=f                  	Distance used for the auto-arrange feature of the plater.
	                                        	 (default: 6)
	--end-filament-gcode=s@                 	This end procedure is inserted at the end of the output file, before the printer end gcode. Note that you can use placeholder variables for all Slic3r settings. If you have multiple extruders, the gcode is processed in extruder order. If Slic3r detects M104, M109, M140 or M190 in your custom codes, such commands will not be prepended automatically so you're free to customize the order of heating commands and other custom actions.
	                                        	 (default: "; Filament-specific end gcode \n;END gcode for filament\n")
	--end-gcode=s                           	This end procedure is inserted at the end of the output file. Note that you can use placeholder variables for all Slic3r settings. If Slic3r detects M104, M109, M140 or M190 in your custom codes, such commands will not be prepended automatically so you're free to customize the order of heating commands and other custom actions.
	                                        	 (default: M104 S0 ; turn off temperature\nG28 X0  ; home X axis\nM84     ; disable motors\n)
	--external-fill-pattern|external-infill-pattern|solid-fill-pattern=s	Fill pattern for top/bottom infill. This only affects the external visible layer, and not its adjacent solid shells.

	--external-perimeter-extrusion-width=s  	Set this to a non-zero value to set a manual extrusion width for external perimeters. If auto is chosen, a value will be used that maximizes accuracy of the external visible surfaces. If expressed as percentage (for example 200%) it will be computed over layer height.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--external-perimeter-speed=s            	This separate setting will affect the speed of external perimeters (the visible ones). If expressed as percentage (for example: 80%) it will be calculated on the perimeters speed setting above.
	                                        	 (default: 50%)
	--external-perimeters-first!            	Print contour perimeters from the outermost one to the innermost one instead of the default inverse order.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--extra-perimeters!                     	Add more perimeters when needed for avoiding gaps in sloping walls.
	                                        	 (default: 1)
	--extruder=i                            	The extruder to use (unless more specific extruder settings are specified).

	--extruder-clearance-height=f           	Set this to the vertical distance between your nozzle tip and (usually) the X carriage rods. In other words, this is the height of the clearance cylinder around your extruder, and it represents the maximum depth the extruder can peek before colliding with other printed objects.
	                                        	 (default: 20)
	--extruder-clearance-radius=f           	Set this to the clearance radius around your extruder. If the extruder is not centered, choose the largest value for safety. This setting is used to check for collisions and to display the graphical preview in the plater.
	                                        	 (default: 20)
	--extruder-offset=s@                    	If your firmware doesn't handle the extruder displacement you need the G-code to take it into account. This option lets you specify the displacement of each extruder with respect to the first one. It expects positive coordinates (they will be subtracted from the XY coordinate).
	                                        	 (default: 0x0)
	--extrusion-axis=s                      	Use this option to set the axis letter associated to your printer's extruder (usually E but some printers use A).
	                                        	 (default: E)
	--extrusion-multiplier=f@               	This factor changes the amount of flow proportionally. You may need to tweak this setting to get nice surface finish and correct single wall widths. Usual values are between 0.9 and 1.1. If you think you need to change this more, check filament diameter and your firmware E steps.
	                                        	 (default: 1)
	--extrusion-width=s                     	Set this to a non-zero value to set a manual extrusion width. If expressed as percentage (for example: 230%) it will be computed over layer height.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--fan-always-on!                        	If this is enabled, fan will never be disabled and will be kept running at least at its minimum speed. Useful for PLA, harmful for ABS.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--fan-below-layer-time=i                	If layer print time is estimated below this number of seconds, fan will be enabled and its speed will be calculated by interpolating the minimum and maximum speeds.
	                                        	 (default: 60)
	--filament-color=s@                     	This is only used in the Slic3r interface as a visual help.
	                                        	 (default: #FFFFFF)
	--filament-cost=f@                      	Enter your filament cost per kg here. This is only for statistical information.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--filament-density=f@                   	Enter your filament density here. This is only for statistical information. A decent way is to weigh a known length of filament and compute the ratio of the length to volume. Better is to calculate the volume directly through displacement.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--filament-diameter=f@                  	Enter your filament diameter here. Good precision is required, so use a caliper and do multiple measurements along the filament, then compute the average.
	                                        	 (default: 3)
	--filament-max-volumetric-speed=f@      	Maximum volumetric speed allowed for this filament. Limits the maximum volumetric speed of a print to the minimum of print and filament volumetric speed. Set to zero for no limit.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--filament-notes=s@                     	You can put your notes regarding the filament here.
	                                        	 (default: "")
	--fill-angle=i                          	Default base angle for infill orientation. Cross-hatching will be applied to this. Bridges will be infilled using the best direction Slic3r can detect, so this setting does not affect them.
	                                        	 (default: 45)
	--fill-density=s                        	Density of internal infill, expressed in the range 0% - 100%.
	                                        	 (default: 20%)
	--fill-gaps!                            	If this is enabled, gaps will be filled with single passes. Enable this for better quality, disable it for shorter printing times.
	                                        	 (default: 1)
	--fill-pattern=s                        	Fill pattern for general low-density infill.
	                                        	 (default: stars)
	--first-layer-acceleration=f            	This is the acceleration your printer will use for first layer. Set zero to disable acceleration control for first layer.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--first-layer-bed-temperature=i         	Heated build plate temperature for the first layer. Set this to zero to disable bed temperature control commands in the output.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--first-layer-extrusion-width=s         	Set this to a non-zero value to set a manual extrusion width for first layer. You can use this to force fatter extrudates for better adhesion. If expressed as percentage (for example 120%) it will be computed over first layer height.
	                                        	 (default: 200%)
	--first-layer-height=s                  	When printing with very low layer heights, you might still want to print a thicker bottom layer to improve adhesion and tolerance for non perfect build plates. This can be expressed as an absolute value or as a percentage (for example: 150%) over the default layer height.

	--infill-only-where-needed!             	This option will limit infill to the areas actually needed for supporting ceilings (it will act as internal support material). If enabled, slows down the G-code generation due to the multiple checks involved.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--infill-overlap=s                      	This setting applies an additional overlap between infill and perimeters for better bonding. Theoretically this shouldn't be needed, but backlash might cause gaps. If expressed as percentage (example: 15%) it is calculated over perimeter extrusion width.

	                                        	 (default: 70)
	--solid-infill-every-layers=i           	This feature allows to force a solid layer every given number of layers. Zero to disable. You can set this to any value (for example 9999); Slic3r will automatically choose the maximum possible number of layers to combine according to nozzle diameter and layer height.
	                                        	 (default: 0)

	                                        	 (default: 1)
	--solid-infill-extrusion-width=s        	Set this to a non-zero value to set a manual extrusion width for infill for solid surfaces. If expressed as percentage (for example 90%) it will be computed over layer height.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--solid-infill-speed=s                  	Speed for printing solid regions (top/bottom/internal horizontal shells). This can be expressed as a percentage (for example: 80%) over the default infill speed above.
	                                        	 (default: 20)
	--solid-layers=i                        	Number of solid layers to generate on top and bottom surfaces.

	--spiral-vase!                          	This feature will raise Z gradually while printing a single-walled object in order to remove any visible seam. This option requires a single perimeter, no infill, no top solid layers and no support material. You can still set any number of bottom solid layers as well as skirt/brim loops. It won't work when printing more than an object.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--standby-temperature-delta=i           	Temperature difference to be applied when an extruder is not active.  Enables a full-height "sacrificial" skirt on which the nozzles are periodically wiped.
	                                        	 (default: -5)
	--start-filament-gcode=s@               	This start procedure is inserted at the beginning, after any printer start gcode. This is used to override settings for a specific filament. If Slic3r detects M104, M109, M140 or M190 in your custom codes, such commands will not be prepended automatically so you're free to customize the order of heating commands and other custom actions. Note that you can use placeholder variables for all Slic3r settings, so you can put a "M109 S[first_layer_temperature]" command wherever you want. If you have multiple extruders, the gcode is processed in extruder order.
	                                        	 (default: "; Filament gcode\n")
	--start-gcode=s                         	This start procedure is inserted at the beginning, after bed has reached the target temperature and extruder just started heating, and before extruder has finished heating. If Slic3r detects M104, M109, M140 or M190 in your custom codes, such commands will not be prepended automatically so you're free to customize the order of heating commands and other custom actions. Note that you can use placeholder variables for all Slic3r settings, so you can put a "M109 S[first_layer_temperature]" command wherever you want.
	                                        	 (default: G28 ; home all axes\nG1 Z5 F5000 ; lift nozzle\n)

	--support-material-angle=i              	Use this setting to rotate the support material pattern on the horizontal plane.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--support-material-buildplate-only!     	Only create support if it lies on a build plate. Don't create support on a print.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--support-material-contact-distance=f   	The vertical distance between object and support material interface. Setting this to 0 will also prevent Slic3r from using bridge flow and speed for the first object layer.
	                                        	 (default: 0.2)
	--support-material-enforce-layers=f     	Generate support material for the specified number of layers counting from bottom, regardless of whether normal support material is enabled or not and regardless of any angle threshold. This is useful for getting more adhesion of objects having a very thin or poor footprint on the build plate.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--support-material-extruder=i           	The extruder to use when printing support material, raft and skirt.
	                                        	 (default: 1)
	--support-material-extrusion-width=s    	Set this to a non-zero value to set a manual extrusion width for support material. If expressed as percentage (for example 90%) it will be computed over layer height.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--support-material-interface-extruder=i 	The extruder to use when printing support material interface. This affects raft too.
	                                        	 (default: 1)
	--support-material-interface-extrusion-width=s	Set this to a non-zero value to set a manual extrusion width for support material interface. If expressed as percentage (for example 90%) it will be computed over layer height.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--support-material-interface-layers=i   	Number of interface layers to insert between the object(s) and support material.
	                                        	 (default: 3)
	--support-material-interface-spacing=f  	Spacing between interface lines. Set zero to get a solid interface.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--support-material-interface-speed=s    	Speed for printing support material interface layers. If expressed as percentage (for example 50%) it will be calculated over support material speed.
	                                        	 (default: 100%)
	--support-material-max-layers=f         	Disable support generation above this layer. Setting this to 0 will disable this feature.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--support-material-pattern=s            	Pattern used to generate support material.
	                                        	 (default: pillars)
	--support-material-pillar-size=f        	Size of the pillars in the pillar support pattern
	                                        	 (default: 2.5)
	--support-material-pillar-spacing=f     	Spacing between pillars in the pillar support pattern
	                                        	 (default: 10)
	--support-material-spacing=f            	Spacing between support material lines.
	                                        	 (default: 2.5)
	--support-material-speed=f              	Speed for printing support material.
	                                        	 (default: 60)
	--support-material-threshold=s          	Support material will not be generated for overhangs whose slope angle (90° = vertical) is above the given threshold. In other words, this value represent the most horizontal slope (measured from the horizontal plane) that you can print without support material. Set to a percentage to automatically detect based on some % of overhanging perimeter width instead (recommended).
	                                        	 (default: 60%)
	--temperature=i@                        	Extruder temperature for layers after the first one. Set this to zero to disable temperature control commands in the output.
	                                        	 (default: 200)
	--thin-walls!                           	Detect single-width walls (parts where two extrusions don't fit and we need to collapse them into a single trace).
	                                        	 (default: 1)
	--threads=i                             	Threads are used to parallelize long-running tasks. Optimal threads number is slightly above the number of available cores/processors.
	                                        	 (default: 4)
	--toolchange-gcode=s                    	This custom code is inserted right before every extruder change. Note that you can use placeholder variables for all Slic3r settings as well as [previous_extruder], [next_extruder], [previous_retraction] and [next_retraction].
	                                        	 (default: )
	--top-infill-extrusion-width=s          	Set this to a non-zero value to set a manual extrusion width for infill for top surfaces. You may want to use thinner extrudates to fill all narrow regions and get a smoother finish. If expressed as percentage (for example 90%) it will be computed over layer height.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--top-infill-pattern=s                  	Infill pattern for top layers. This only affects the external visible layer, and not its adjacent solid shells.
	                                        	 (default: rectilinear)
	--top-solid-infill-speed=s              	Speed for printing top solid layers (it only applies to the uppermost external layers and not to their internal solid layers). You may want to slow down this to get a nicer surface finish. This can be expressed as a percentage (for example: 80%) over the solid infill speed above.
	                                        	 (default: 15)

	                                        	 (default: 130)
	--use-firmware-retraction!              	This experimental setting uses G10 and G11 commands to have the firmware handle the retraction. This is only supported in recent Marlin.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--use-relative-e-distances!             	If your firmware requires relative E values, check this, otherwise leave it unchecked. Most firmwares use absolute values.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--use-set-and-wait-heatbed!             	If your firmware supports a set and wait gcode for temperature changes, use it for automatically inserted temperature gcode for the heatbed. Does not affect custom gcode.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--use-set-and-wait-extruder!            	If your firmware supports a set and wait gcode for temperature changes, use it for automatically inserted temperature gcode for all extruders. Does not affect custom gcode.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--use-volumetric-e!                     	This experimental setting uses outputs the E values in cubic millimeters instead of linear millimeters. If your firmware doesn't already know filament diameter(s), you can put commands like 'M200 D[filament_diameter_0] T0' in your start G-code in order to turn volumetric mode on and use the filament diameter associated to the filament selected in Slic3r. This is only supported in recent Marlin.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--vibration-limit=f                     	This experimental option will slow down those moves hitting the configured frequency limit. The purpose of limiting vibrations is to avoid mechanical resonance. Set zero to disable.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--wipe!                                 	This flag will move the nozzle while retracting to minimize the possible blob on leaky extruders.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--xy-size-compensation=f                	The object will be grown/shrunk in the XY plane by the configured value (negative = inwards, positive = outwards). This might be useful for fine-tuning hole sizes.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--z-offset=f                            	This value will be added (or subtracted) from all the Z coordinates in the output G-code. It is used to compensate for bad Z endstop position: for example, if your endstop zero actually leaves the nozzle 0.3mm far from the print bed, set this to -0.3 (or fix your endstop).
	                                        	 (default: 0)
	--z-steps-per-mm=f                      	Set this to the number of *full* steps (not microsteps) needed for moving the Z axis by 1mm; you can calculate this by dividing the number of microsteps configured in your firmware by the microstepping amount (8, 16, 32). Slic3r will round your configured layer height to the nearest multiple of that value in order to ensure the best accuracy. This is most useful for machines with imperial leadscrews or belt-driven Z or for unusual layer heights with metric leadscrews. If you still experience wobbling, try using 4 * full_step to achieve the same motor phase pattern for every layer (important for belt driven z-axis). Set to zero to disable this experimental feature.
	                                        	 (default: 0)
